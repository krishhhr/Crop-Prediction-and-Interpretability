## üßê Introduction
Agriculture, the backbone of many economies, faces challenges such as:
- **Climate change**
- **Soil degradation**
- **Resource scarcity**

Using data-driven ML techniques, this project optimizes crop selection, yield prediction, and resource allocation to address these challenges.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains **2,200 entries** and includes the following features:

| Feature      | Description                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `N`          | Nitrogen content              |
| `P`          | Phosphorus content           |
| `K`          | Potassium content            |
| `Temperature`| Soil temperature (¬∞C)       |
| `Humidity`   | Ambient humidity (%)        |
| `pH`         | Soil acidity level           |
| `Rainfall`   | Rainfall levels (mm)         |

### Key Insights:
- **Nitrogen levels** range from 0‚Äì140, with an average of 68.
- **Rainfall** shows significant variation, reflecting diverse climates.
- **pH values** span 3.5‚Äì9.5, indicating varied soil types.

### 3. **Model Selection**
Three models were evaluated:
- **Random Forest:** Achieved **99.7% accuracy**.
- **Gradient Boosting:** Optimized for minimal error.
- **Naive Bayes:** Used as a baseline.

### 4. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to:
- Interpret predictions globally and locally.
- Visualize feature importance.
